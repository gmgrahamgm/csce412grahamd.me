            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The rock dove (Columba livia), also known as the rock pigeon or common pigeon, is a member of the bird
                family Columbidae (doves and pigeons). In common usage, it is often simply referred to as the "pigeon",
                although the rock dove is the wild form of the bird; the pigeons familiar to most people are the
                domesticated forms of the wild rock dove.</p>

            <p>Wild rock doves are uniformly pale grey with two black bars on each wing. The domestic pigeon, which
                includes about 1,000 different breeds, is descended from this species. Escaped domestic pigeons are the
                origin of feral pigeons around the world. Both forms can vary widely in the colour and pattern of their
                plumage.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The adult of the nominate subspecies of the rock dove is 29 to 37 cm long with a 62 to 72 cm wingspan.
                Weight for wild or feral rock doves ranges from 238–380 grams, though overfed domestic and semidomestic
                individuals can exceed normal weights.</p>

            <p>This species has dark bluish-grey head, neck, and chest feathers with glossy greenish, and reddish-purple
                iridescence along its neck feathers. The white lower back of the pure rock dove is its best
                identification characteristic; the two black bars on its pale grey wings are also distinctive. The tail
                has a black band on the end, and the outer web of the tail feathers are margined with white.</p>

            <p>The iris is orange, red, or golden with a paler inner ring. The bill is grey-black with a conspicuous
                off-white cere. The feet are red to pink. The adult female is almost identical in outward appearance to
                the male, but the iridescence on her neck is less intense and more restricted.</p>

            <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
            <p>Before the Columbian Exchange, rock doves were restricted to a natural resident range in western and
                southern Europe, North Africa, and extending into South Asia. They were carried into the New World
                aboard European ships between 1603 and 1607. The species now has a large range, with an estimated global
                extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 square kilometers.</p>

            <p>Wild pigeons reside in rock formations and cliff faces, settling in crevices to nest. They nest
                communally, often forming large colonies of many hundreds of individuals. Wild nesting sites include
                caves, canyons, and sea cliffs. Feral pigeons are usually unable to find these accommodations, so they
                must nest on building ledges, walls or statues.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Urban Adaptation</h3>
                <p>Feral pigeons have adapted remarkably well to urban environments. Buildings provide an excellent
                    imitation of cliff structures, making rock doves very common around human habitation. Skyscrapers,
                    highway overpasses, farm buildings, abandoned buildings, and other human structures with ample
                    crevices are conducive to rock dove nesting. Thus the modern range of the rock dove is due in large
                    part to humans.</p>

            <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
            <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
            <p>The species can breed at any time of the year due to their ability to produce crop milk, but peak times
                are spring and summer, when the food supply is abundant enough to support embryonic egg development.
                Laying of eggs can take place up to six times per year.</p>

            <p>The rock dove is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents care for the young
                for a time. Current evidence suggests that wild, domestic and feral pigeons mate for life. Two white
                eggs are laid; incubation, shared by both parents, lasts 17 to 19 days. The newly hatched squab(s) has
                pale yellow down and a flesh-coloured bill. A rock dove's lifespan ranges from 3–5 years in the wild to
                15 years in captivity.</p>

            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>Rock doves are omnivorous, but prefer plant matter: chiefly fruits and grains. Pigeons feed on the ground
                in flocks or individually. Pigeon groups typically consist of "producers", which scout out food sources,
                and "scroungers", which follow the producers and feed on food located by them. Pigeons are naturally
                granivorous, eating seeds that fit down their gullet. They may sometimes consume small invertebrates
                such as worms or insect larvae as a protein supplement.</p>

            <p>While most birds take small sips and tilt their heads backwards when drinking, pigeons are able to dip
                their bills into the water and drink continuously, without having to tilt their heads back.</p>

            <h3>Predators</h3>
            <p>With only their flying abilities protecting them from predation, rock doves around the world are a
                favourite prey item for a wide range of raptors. Peregrine falcons and Eurasian sparrowhawks are natural
                predators of pigeons and quite adept at catching and feeding upon this species. In all life stages, rock
                doves are at risk from domestic cats, including strays.</p>

            <h2>Relationship to Humans</h2>
            <p>Rock doves have been domesticated for several thousand years, giving rise to the domestic pigeon. They
                may have been domesticated as long as 5,000 years ago. Domesticated pigeons are used as homing pigeons
                as well as food and pets. They were in the past also used as carrier pigeons, used to deliver messages
                in peacetime or during war.</p>

            <p>The rock dove was central to Charles Darwin's discovery of evolution, and featured in four of his works
                from 1859 to 1872. Darwin posited that, despite wide-ranging morphological differences, the many
                hundreds of breeds of domestic pigeon could all be traced back to the wild rock dove; in essence human
                selection of pigeon breeds was analogous to natural selection.</p>

            <p>Rock doves often have a commensal relationship with humans, gaining both ample access to food and nesting
                spots in inhabited areas. While some view them as pests, particularly in urban environments, they remain
                an integral part of city ecosystems worldwide.</p>
