            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) is a passerine bird in the sparrow family with a rich
                chestnut crown and nape and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged,
                and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia
                and Southeast Asia, where it is known as the tree sparrow.</p>

            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow's untidy nest is built in a natural cavity, a hole in a building, or the
                disused nest of a European magpie or white stork. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and
                diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.
            </p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow is 12.5–14 cm long, with a wingspan of about 21 cm and a weight of 24 grams,
                making it roughly 10% smaller than the house sparrow. The adult's crown and nape are rich chestnut, and
                there is a kidney-shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek. The chin, throat, and the area
                between the bill and throat are black.</p>

            <p>The upperparts are light brown, streaked with black, and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white
                bars. The legs are pale brown, and the bill is lead-blue in summer, becoming almost black in winter.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Unique Feature</h3>
                <p>This sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between the
                    sexes; the juvenile also resembles the adult, although the colours tend to be duller. Its
                    contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow's natural breeding range comprises most of temperate Europe and Asia south of
                about latitude 68°N and through Southeast Asia to Java and Bali. It is sedentary over most of its
                extensive range, but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for the winter, and small numbers
                leave southern Europe for North Africa and the Middle East.</p>

            <p>In Europe, the Eurasian tree sparrow shows a strong preference for nest-sites near wetland habitats and
                avoids breeding on intensively managed mixed farmland. When the Eurasian tree sparrow and the larger
                house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow generally breeds in urban areas while the
                smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside.</p>

            <p>In eastern Asia, however, it is an urban bird. In southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be
                found around towns and villages. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird.</p>

            <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
            <h3>Breeding</h3>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow reaches breeding maturity within a year from hatching, and typically builds its
                nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face. Some nests are built among roots of overhanging gorse or
                similar bush. Roof cavities in houses may be used, and in the tropics, the crown of a palm tree or the
                ceiling of a verandah can serve as a nest site.</p>

            <p>Pairs may breed in isolation or loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. The male calls from near
                the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate. The untidy nest is composed of hay,
                grass, wool or other material and lined with feathers. The typical clutch is five or six eggs which
                hatch in 12–13 days, and the altricial chicks fledge after 15–18 days. Two or three broods may be raised
                each year.</p>

            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow is a predominantly seed and grain-eating bird which feeds on the ground in
                flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and
                goosefoot, spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts.</p>

            <p>It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly
                on animal food. It takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen. Adults use a
                variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow has a large range estimated as 98.3 million square kilometres and a population
                of 190–310 million individuals. Although the population is declining, the species is not believed to
                approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List. For these reasons,
                the species' conservation status is evaluated at the global level as being of Least Concern.</p>

            <p>Although the Eurasian tree sparrow has been expanding its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe,
                populations have been declining in much of western Europe. The collapse in populations seems to have
                been particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
                <p>The large decline in Eurasian tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural
                    intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards
                    autumn-sown crops. The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of
                    insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Relationship with Humans</h2>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow is seen as a pest in some areas. In Australia, it damages many cereal and fruit
                crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its droppings.</p>

            <p>In China, Mao Zedong attempted in April 1958 to reduce crop damage by Eurasian tree sparrows through the
                "Four Pests Campaign," mobilising millions of people to drive the birds to death by exhaustion. Although
                successful at reducing the sparrow population, the campaign overlooked the numbers of locusts and other
                insect pests consumed by the birds. Crop yields collapsed, exacerbating a famine that led to the deaths
                of millions of people between 1959 and 1961.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>The Eurasian tree sparrow has long been depicted in Chinese and Japanese art, often on a plant spray or
                in a flying flock. The fluttering of the bird gave rise to a traditional Japanese dance, the Suzume
                Odori, developed in Sendai.</p>

            <p>In the Philippines, where it is one of several species referred to as maya, the Eurasian tree sparrow is
                the most common bird in the cities. Many urban Filipinos confuse it with the former national bird of the
                Philippines, the black-headed munia.</p>
