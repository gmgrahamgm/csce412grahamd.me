            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Javan myna, also known as the white-vented myna, is a species of myna in the starling family
                Sturnidae. It is native to Java and Bali in Indonesia, where its population has declined significantly
                due to excessive trapping for the cage-bird trade. Paradoxically, while the species is considered
                vulnerable in its native range, it has become a highly successful invasive species in several other
                countries, most notably Singapore, where it is now the most abundant bird species.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Javan myna is a stocky, medium-sized bird measuring 21–23 cm in length and weighing approximately 100
                grams. The plumage is mainly black with a slight glossy sheen. The wings are brownish-black, and the
                primary feathers have white bases that form a striking white wing bar visible during flight. A white
                tail bar is also displayed in flight. The undertail coverts are white, which is the basis for the
                alternative name "white-vented myna."</p>

            <p>A short, erect crest adorns the forehead. The beak, legs, and feet are bright yellow. The iris is
                lemon-yellow, which distinguishes it from the common myna (Acridotheres tristis), which has a brown
                iris. Immature birds are browner and duller than adults, with less prominent crests and paler soft
                parts.</p>

            <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
            <p>The Javan myna is native to Java and Bali in Indonesia. In its native range, the species has experienced
                significant population declines due to heavy trapping pressure for the cage-bird trade, and is now
                considered uncommon to rare in many areas where it was formerly abundant.</p>

            <p>The species has been introduced to numerous locations across Asia and beyond, including Southeast Asia
                (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Lesser Sunda Islands), East Asia (Taiwan and Japan), South Asia
                (Nepal), and the Caribbean (Puerto Rico).</p>

                <h3>Singapore Success Story</h3>
                <p>Javan mynas were first introduced to Singapore in the 1920s through the cage-bird trade. The species
                    has since become extraordinarily successful and is now the most common bird in Singapore. Studies
                    have found that the Javan myna comprises a substantial proportion of the total bird population in
                    urban areas of Singapore.</p>
                <p>The success of the Javan myna in Singapore has been attributed to several factors, including its
                    highly adaptable diet, tolerance of human activity, aggressive behaviour towards competing species,
                    and the abundance of nesting sites in urban structures.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
            <h3>Social Behaviour</h3>
            <p>Javan mynas are gregarious birds that are typically found in pairs or small groups. They associate in
                larger flocks at favoured feeding sites and communal roosts. The species is notably bold and shows
                little fear of humans; individuals often remain in place even when approached to within two metres.</p>

            <p>When foraging, Javan mynas typically scavenge in groups of two to four or more individuals. Usually, one
                bird acts as a sentinel, keeping watch from a vantage point while the others feed. If the sentinel
                detects a potential threat, it alerts the group with a high-pitched alarm call, prompting all members to
                flee the area swiftly.</p>

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>The Javan myna is omnivorous and highly opportunistic in its feeding habits. Its diet includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Invertebrates, particularly insects</li>
                <li>Seeds and grains</li>
                <li>Fruits</li>
                <li>Nectar</li>
                <li>Human food waste and scraps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This dietary flexibility is a key factor in the species' success in urban environments, where it readily
                exploits anthropogenic food sources.</p>

            <h3>Breeding</h3>
            <p>Javan mynas are monogamous and form pair bonds. They are cavity nesters, building nests in holes in
                trees, buildings, and other structures. In urban areas, they commonly nest in gaps in buildings, roof
                spaces, air conditioning units, and similar cavities. The female lays a clutch of 2–5 eggs, which are
                blue in colour. The incubation period is 13–14 days, and the fledgling period lasts approximately 25
                days.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
            <p>The Javan myna is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. This assessment refers to the species'
                status in its native range of Java and Bali, where populations have declined substantially due to
                intensive trapping for the cage-bird trade. Keeping songbirds in cages is a deeply rooted cultural
                tradition in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, and the Javan myna is among the many species
                affected by this practice.</p>

            <p>The species' situation represents an unusual conservation paradox: while it is threatened in its native
                range, it has become superabundant and even problematic as an invasive species in several countries
                where it has been introduced.</p>

            <h2>Relationship with Humans</h2>
            <p>In Singapore and other areas where the species has become established, Javan mynas are sometimes
                considered pests due to the noise produced at communal roosts, their droppings, and their tendency to
                scavenge food from outdoor eating areas. However, they have also become an integral part of Singapore's
                urban wildlife and are appreciated by many residents for their intelligence and adaptability.</p>
