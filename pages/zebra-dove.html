            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The zebra dove (Geopelia striata), also known as the barred ground dove or barred dove, is a species of
                bird of the dove family, Columbidae, native to Southeast Asia. They are small birds with a long tail,
                predominantly brownish-grey in colour with black-and-white barring. The species is known for its
                pleasant, soft, staccato cooing calls.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The birds are small and slender with a long, narrow tail. The upperparts are brownish-grey with
                black-and-white barring. The underparts are pinkish with black bars on the sides of the neck, breast and
                belly. The face is blue-grey with bare blue skin around the eyes. There are white tips to the tail
                feathers. Juveniles are duller and paler than the adults. Zebra doves are 20–23 centimetres in length
                with a wingspan of 24–26 cm.</p>

            <p>Their call is a series of soft, staccato cooing notes. In Thailand and Indonesia, the birds are popular
                as pets because of their calls and cooing competitions are held to find the bird with the best voice. In
                Indonesia this bird is called perkutut. In the Philippines they are known as batobatong katigbe
                ("pebbled katigbe") and kurokutok, onomatopoeic to their calls.</p>

            <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
            <p>The native range of the species extends from Southern Thailand, Tenasserim, Peninsular Malaysia, and
                Singapore to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. It may also be native to Borneo, Bali, Lombok,
                Sumbawa, and the Philippine islands.</p>

            <p>The zebra dove is popular in captivity and many populations have appeared outside its native range due to
                birds escaping or being deliberately released. It can now be found in central Thailand, Laos, Borneo,
                Sulawesi, Hawaii (introduced in 1922), Tahiti (1950), New Caledonia, the Seychelles, the Chagos
                Archipelago (1960), Mauritius (before 1768), Réunion, and Saint Helena.</p>

                <h3>Habitat Preferences</h3>
                <p>It inhabits scrub, farmland, and open country in lowland areas and is commonly seen in parks and
                    gardens. In Singapore, zebra doves are a familiar sight in urban parks, residential gardens, and
                    open grassy areas. They prefer to forage on bare ground or short grass, often seen walking with
                    characteristic rodent-like movement.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
            <h3>Breeding</h3>
            <p>In its native range, the breeding season lasts from September to June. The males perform a courtship
                display where they bow and coo while raising and spreading the tail. Upon selection of a nesting site,
                the female will place herself there and will make guttural sounds to attract males to help build the
                nest.</p>

            <p>The nest is a simple platform of leaves and grass blades. It is built in a bush or tree or sometimes on
                the ground and sometimes on window ledges. One or two white eggs are laid and are incubated by both
                parents for 13 to 18 days. The young leave the nest within two weeks and can fly well after three weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>The zebra dove feeds on small grass and weed seeds. They will also eat insects and other small
                invertebrates. They prefer to forage on bare ground, short grass or on roads, scurrying about with
                rodent-like movement. Unlike other doves, they forage alone, or in pairs. Their colouration camouflages
                them well when on the ground.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
            <p>The zebra dove is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. Although trapping for the cagebird
                industry has led to them becoming rare in parts of Indonesia, in most parts of its range it is common.
                Zebra doves are among the most abundant birds in some places such as Hawaii and the Seychelles.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>In Southeast Asian cultures, the zebra dove holds special significance. In Indonesia and Thailand, these
                birds are highly prized for their melodious calls, and singing competitions are a traditional pastime.
                Owners train their birds and compete to see whose dove has the most beautiful or complex song. These
                competitions can draw large crowds and considerable prize money.</p>

            <p>In Singapore, the zebra dove is a common sight and sound in urban and suburban areas, its gentle cooing
                forming part of the city's soundscape. The species has adapted well to human presence and is often seen
                foraging in parks, gardens, and even parking lots.</p>
